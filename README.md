# File Uploader App 

A web application for uploading, indexing, searching, and managing PDF and Word documents.  
The app uses **AWS S3** for file storage, **SQS** for queuing, **OpenSearch (Elasticsearch)** for indexing, and **NestJS** backend with **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for live updates.

---

## ‚ú® Features

### üìù User Flow
1. User visits the website and enters a **valid email**.
2. After login, the user can:
   - Upload **one file at a time** (`.pdf` and `.word` only)
   - Files are uploaded to **AWS S3** and stored securely
3. Backend listens to **SQS queue** to parse and index files to **OpenSearch**
   - Status tracking: `Pending`, `Success`, `Error`
   - Frontend receives **live updates** via SSE per user
4. Users can:
   - **List** uploaded documents (filename & upload date)
   - **Search** documents (results show filename and highlighted text)
   - **Delete** documents (removes from DB, OpenSearch, and S3)

### ‚ö° Status Indicators
- `Pending` ‚Äì document uploaded, indexing in progress
- `Success` ‚Äì document successfully indexed, searchable
- `Error` ‚Äì indexing failed

### üöÄ Real-Time Updates
- SSE connection per user (not per document) for scalable live status updates
